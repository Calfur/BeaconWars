# Beacon Wars
## The Minecraft PvP Project
The basic idea of BeaconWars is to make a Minecraft PvP event more exciting. For this we looked at past projects and searched for improvements. BeaconWars is the result of a year of collecting ideas, programming and optimizing. In April 2021, we organizers played the project with our friends using version 1.0 of BeaconWars. The project was a great success, never before have we played a project for such a long time. Since then the plugin was regularly improved. With the Version 2.0 the Plugin is on a higher level than ever before. The user friendliness and usability is at a high level now.
