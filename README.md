# Beacon Wars
## The plugins developed for Minecraft Team Events
The Main goal of Beacon Wars is, to improve a Minecraft Team PvP Server with some rules. Other than in similar projects the goal is not last man standing wins. Instead it includes a team based point-system. Points are payed for kills, rubbed beacons you are able to pay points for custom events like a build event.<br>
Except from that, the main change is how you get diamonds. You can't get them naturally with mining or finding them in chests. Istead you get them as bounty from kills.<br>
Furthermore there is a base system included, with a buildmode and the possibility to rub beacons from other teams during the beacon events.
