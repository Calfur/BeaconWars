# Beacon Wars
## The plugins developed for Minecraft Team Events
The Main goal of these Plugins are, improving a Minecraft Team PvP Server. With several changes in how to get weapons, the combat system becomes more exciting. The main Change is how you get diamonds. You can't mine them or find them in chests. Istead you get them as bounty from kills. <br />
Furthermore there is a base system included, with a buildmode and the possibility to rub beacons from other teams during the beacon events.
